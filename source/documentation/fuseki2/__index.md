Apache Jena Fuseki is a SPARQL server.  It can run as a standalone server, or embedded in an
application.

Fuseki provides the
SPARQL 1.1 [protocols for query and update](http://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-protocol/)
as well as the
[SPARQL Graph Store protocol](http://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-http-rdf-update/).

Fuseki is integrated with [TDB](../tdb/index.html) to provide a robust,
transactional, persistent storage layer. Fuseki also incorporates
[Jena text query](../query/text-query.html).

This includes the packaged build of Fuseki.
