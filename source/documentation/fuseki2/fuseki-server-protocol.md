title: Fuseki HTTP Administration Protocol
---

This page describes the HTTP Protocol used to control an Fuseki server via
its administrative interface.

* [Operations](#operations)
* [Server Information](#server-information)
* [Datasets and Services](#datasets-and-services)
    * Adding a Dataset and its Services
    * Removing a Dataset
    * Dormant and Active
* [Removing a dataset](#remove-dataset)

All admin operations have URL paths starting `/$/` to avoid clashes with
dataset names and this prefix is reserved for the Fuseki control functions.
Further operations may be added within this naming scheme.

## Operations

Replace `{name}` with a dataset name: e.g. `/$/backup/myDataset`.

## Ping
Pattern: `/$/ping`

The URL `/$/ping` is a guaranteed low cost point to test whether a server
is running or not.  It returns no other information other than to respond to the
request over `GET` or `POST` (to avoid any HTTP caching) with a 200 response.

Return: empty body

## Server Information 
Pattern: `/$/server`

The URL `/$/server` returns details about the server and it's current status in JSON.

_@@details of JSON format._

## Datasets and Services
Pattern: `/$/datasets`

`/$/datasets` is a container representing all datasets present in the server. 
`/$/datasets/{name}` names a specific dataset.  As a container, operations on items
in the container, via `GET`, `POST` and `DELETE`, operate on specific dataset.

### Adding a Dataset and its Services.

> _@@ May add server-managed templates_

A dataset set can be added to a running server. There are several methods
for doing this: 

* Post the assembler file
* HTML Form upload the assembler file 
* Use a built-in template (in-memory or persistent)

All require HTTP `POST`.

Changes to the server state are carried across restarts.  

For persistent datasets, for example [TDB](/documentation/tdb),
the dataset is persists across restart.

For in-memory datasets, the dataset is rebuilt from it's description
(this may include loading data from a file) but any changes are lost.

#### Templates

A short-cut form for some common set-ups is provided by <tt>POST</tt>ing with
the following parameters (query string or HTML form):

| Parameter |                 |
|-----------|-----------------|
| `dbType`  | Either `mem` or `tdb` |
| `dbName`  | URL path name   |

The dataset name must not be already in-use.

Datasets are created in directory `databases/`.

#### Assembler example

The assembler description contains data and service.  It can be sent by posting the assembler RDF graph
in any RDF format or by posting from an HTML form (the syntax must be Turtle).

The assembler file is stored by the server will be used on restart or when making the dataset active again.

### Removing a Dataset

Note: `DELETE` means "gone for ever".  The dataset name and the details of its
configuration are completely deleted and can not be recovered.  

The data of a TDB dataset is not deleted.

### Active and Offline

A dataset is in one of two modes: "active", meaning it is services request over HTTP
(subject to configuration and security), or "offline", meaning the configuration and name 
is known about by the server but the dataset is not attached to the server.  When "offline",
any persistent data can be manipulated outside the server.

Datasets are initially "active".  The transition from "active" to "offline" is graceful - all outstanding requests are completed.

## Statistics
> **`/$/stats/{name}`**

Statistics can be obtained for each dataset or all datasets in a single response.
`/$/stats` is  treated as a container for this information.

> _@@ stats details_
> See [Fuseki Server Information](fuseki-server-info.html) for details of statistics kept by a Fuseki server.

### Backup 
Pattern: `/$/backup/{name}`

This operation initiates a backup and returns a JSON object with the task Id in it.

Backups are written to the server local directory 'backups' as gzip-compressed N-Quads files.

See [Tasks](#tasks) for how to monitor a backups progress.

Return: A task is allocated a identifier (usually, a number).
```
{ "taskId" : "{taskId}" }
```
The task id can be used to construct a URL to get details of the task:
```
/$/tasks/{taskId}
```

Pattern: `/$/backups-list`

Returns a list of all the files in the backup area of the server. This is
useful for managing the files externally.

The returned JSON object will have the form `{ backups: [ ... ] }` where the `[]` array is
a list of file names.

Since 4.7.0 backups are written to a temporary file in the same directory and renamed on completion.
In case of server crash, it will not be renamed.
This guarantees backups are complete.
Cleanup of incomplete backups can be done by users on application / container start: remove all incomplete files.g

### Backup policies

Users can use the backup api [the Fuseki HTTP Administration Protocol](/documentation/fuseki2/fuseki-server-protocol.html#backup) to build backup policies.
See issue for more information https://github.com/apache/jena/issues/1500 .

### Compact
Pattern: `/$/compact/{name}`

This operations initiates a database compaction task and returns a JSON object with the task Id in it.

The optional parameter and value `deleteOld=true` deletes the database which currently is compacted after compacting completion.

Compaction **ONLY** applies to TDB2 datasets, see [TDB2 Database Administration](../tdb2/tdb2_admin.html#compaction)
for more details of this operation.

You can monitor the status of the task via the Tasks portion of the API.  A successful compaction will have 
the `finishPoint` field set and `success` field set to `true`.

## Tasks
Some operations cause a background task to be executed, backup is an example.
The result of such operations includes a json object with the task id and
also a `Location:` header with the URL of the task created.

The progress of the task can be monitored with HTTP GET operations:

Pattern: `/$/tasks` &ndash; All asynchronous tasks.<br/>
Pattern: `/$/tasks/{taskId}` &ndash; A particular task.

The URL `/$/tasks` returns a description of all running and recently tasks. A finished task can be identified by having a `finishPoint` and `success` fields.

Each background task has an id.  The URL `/$/tasks/{taskId}` gets a description about one single task.

Details of the last few completed tasks are retained, up to a fixed number. The records will eventually be removed as later tasks complete, and the task URL will then return 404.

Pattern: `/$/tasks` ; example:
```
[ { 
    "finished" : "2014-05-28T12:52:51.860+01:00" ,
    "started" : "2014-05-28T12:52:50.859+01:00" ,
    "task" : "sleep" ,
    "taskId" : "1" ,
    "success" : true
  } ,
  { 
    "finished" : "2014-05-28T12:53:24.718+01:00" ,
    "started" : "2014-05-28T12:53:14.717+01:00" ,
    "task" : "sleep" ,
    "taskId" : "2" ,
    "success" : true
  }
]
```
Pattern: `/$/tasks/1` : example:
```
[ { 
    "finished" : "2014-05-28T13:54:13.608+01:00" ,
    "started" : "2014-05-28T13:54:03.607+01:00" ,
    "task" : "backup" ,
    "taskId" : "1" ,
    "success" : false
  }
]
```
This is inside an array to make the format returned the same as `/$/tasks`.
