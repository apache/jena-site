Welcome to the Apache Jena project! Jena is a Java framework for building
Semantic Web applications.
Jena provides a collection of tools and Java libraries to help you
to develop [semantic web](https://www.w3.org/2001/sw/) and
[linked-data](https://linkeddata.org/) apps, tools and servers.

The Jena Framework includes:

* an API for reading, processing and writing [RDF](https://www.w3.org/RDF/) data in XML, N-triples and Turtle formats;
* an ontology API for handling [OWL](https://www.w3.org/standards/techs/owl#w3c_all) and RDFS ontologies;
* a rule-based inference engine for reasoning with RDF and OWL data sources;
* stores to allow large numbers of RDF triples to be efficiently stored on disk;
* a query engine compliant with the latest [SPARQL](https://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/query) specification
* servers to allow RDF data to be published to other applications using a variety
of protocols, including SPARQL

In April 2012, Jena graduated from the Apache incubator process and
was approved as a top-level Apache project.
