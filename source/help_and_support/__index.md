title: Getting help with Jena

We are always happy to help you get your Jena project going. Jena has been around
for many years, there are many archives of past questions, tutorials and articles
on the web. A quick search may well answer your question directly! If not, please
feel free to post a question to the user support list (details below).

## Email support lists

The *main user support list* is `users@jena.apache.org`. To join this
list, please send an email to: <a href="mailto:users-subscribe@jena.apache.org">
`users-subscribe@jena.apache.org`</a> from the email account you want
to subscribe with. This list is a good place to ask for advice on developing Jena-based
applications, or solving  a problem with using Jena. *Please see below for notes
on asking good questions*. The list is archived at
[lists.apache.org](https://lists.apache.org/list.html?users@jena.apache.org)
or externally at [jena.markmail.org](http://jena.markmail.org/search/)

The *developers* list is `dev@jena.apache.org`. To join this
list, please send an email to: <a href="mailto:dev-subscribe@jena.apache.org">
`dev-subscribe@jena.apache.org`</a> from the email account you want
to subscribe with. This list is a good place to discuss the development of the Jena
platform itself, including patches you want to submit.

To unsubscribe from a mailing list, send email to `LIST-unsubscribe@jena.apache.org`.

Full details of Apache mailing lists: [http://www.apache.org/foundation/mailinglists.html](http://www.apache.org/foundation/mailinglists.html).

## Other resources

There are curated collections of Jena questions on StackOverflow 
[tagged 'jena'](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/jena) and 
['apache-jena'](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/apache-jena).
There are also [questions and answers about SPARQL](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/sparql).

## How to ask a good question

Asking good questions is **the best way to get good answers**. Try to follow these tips:

  - Make the question **precise** and **specific**. *"My code doesn't work"*, for example, does not help us to help you
  as much as *"The following SPARQL query gave me an answer I didn't expect"*.

  - Show that you've **tried to solve the problem yourself**. Everyone who answers questions on the list
  has a full-time job or study to do; no-one gets paid for answering these support questions. Spend
  their goodwill wisely: *"Here's the code I tried..."* or *"I read in the documentation that ..."* shows that
  you've at least made some effort to find things out for yourself.

  - Where appropriate **show a complete test case**. Seeing where your code goes wrong is generally
  much easier if we can run it our computers. Corollaries: **don't post your entire project** - take some
  time to reduce it down to a minimal test case. **Include enough data** - runnable code is no help if
  critical resources like `*.rdf` files are missing. Reducing your code down to a minimal test case
  is often enough for you to figure out the problem yourself, which is always satisfying!

  - **Don't re-post your question** after only a few hours. People are busy, and may be in a different timezone
  to you. If you're not sure if your question made it to the list, [look in the archive](http://markmail.org/search/?q=list:org.apache.jena.*).

  - **Adding lots of exclamation marks** or other punctuation will **not** move your question up the queue. Quite the
  reverse, in fact.

  - Ask questions **on the list, rather than emailing the developers directly**. This gives us the chance to share the
  load of answering questions, and also ensures that answers are archived in case they're of use to others in the future.
