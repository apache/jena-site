Apache Jena (or Jena in short) is a free and open source Java 
framework for building [semantic web](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web) and 
[Linked Data](http://linkeddata.org/) applications.
The framework is composed of different APIs interacting together to process RDF data. If you are new here, you might want to
get started by following one of the [tutorials](/tutorials/index.html). You can also browse [the documentation](/documentation/index.html) if you are interested in a particular topic.

* [RDF API tutorial](/tutorials/rdf_api.html) - you will learn 
the essence of the semantic web and the graph representation
behind RDF.
* [SPARQL tutorial](/tutorials/sparql.html) - will guide you 
to formulate expressive queries over RDF data.
* [Ontology API](/documentation/ontology) - illustrates the
usage of advanced semantic web features such as reasoning over your data using OWL.
* Finally, [some of the tutorials](/tutorials/index.html) are also available in Traditional Chinese, Portuguese and French.

The following topics are covered in the documentation:

* [The RDF API](/documentation/rdf/) - the core RDF API in Jena
* [SPARQL](/documentation/query/) - querying and updating RDF models using the SPARQL standards
* [Fuseki](/documentation/fuseki2/) - SPARQL server which can present RDF data and answer SPARQL queries over HTTP
* [Assembler](/documentation/assembler/) - describing recipes for constructing Jena models declaratively using RDF
* [Inference](/documentation/inference/) - using the Jena rules engine and other inference algorithms to derive consequences from RDF models
* [Javadoc](/documentation/javadoc/) - JavaDoc generated from the Jena source
* [Text Search](/documentation/query/text-query.html) - enhanced indexes using Lucene or Solr for more efficient searching of text literals in Jena models and datasets
* [I/O](/documentation/io/) - notes on input and output of triples to and from Jena models
* [How-To's](/documentation/notes/) - various topic-specific how-to documents
* [Ontology](/documentation/ontology/) - support for handling OWL models in Jena
* [TDB](/documentation/tdb/) - a fast persistent triple store that stores directly to disk
* [Tools](/documentation/tools/) - various command-line tools and utilities to help developers manage RDF data and other aspects of Jena
