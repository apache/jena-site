      <description>We are always happy to help you get your Jena project going. Jena has been around for many years, there are many archives of past questions, tutorials and articles on the web. A quick search may well answer your question directly! If not, please feel free to post a question to the user support list (details below).
Email support lists The main user support list is users@jena.apache.org. To join this list, please send an email to: users-subscribe@jena.</description>

      <description>Please report bugs using Jena&amp;rsquo;s GitHub Issues or ASF&amp;rsquo;s JIRA instance for Jena.
General suggestions or requests for changes can also be discussed on the user list or Jena&amp;rsquo;s GitHub Discussions but are less likely to be accidentally forgotten if you log them into JIRA or a GitHub Issue.
For any security issues please refer to our Security Advisories page for how those should be reported and handled.
Patches and other code contributions should also be attached to issues in JIRA (click on More Actions &amp;gt; Attach Files) or made via git pull requests.</description>
