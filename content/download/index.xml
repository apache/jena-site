      <description>Apache Maven is a tool to help Java projects manage their dependencies on library code, such as Jena. By declaring a dependency on the core of Jena in your project&amp;rsquo;s pom.xml file, you will get the consistent set of library files that Jena depends on automatically added too.
This page assumes you have Maven installed on your computer. If this is not the case, please read and follow these instructions.</description>
