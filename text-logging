### Fuseki loggers

| Logger    | Usage |
| -------   | ----- |
| Fuseki    | The action log used for all endpoint requests |
| Server    | Server information                       |
| Admin     | Server administration operations         |
| Config    | Dataset build/configuration log          |
| Request   | NCSA [Common Log Format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Log_Format) |
| Backup    | Log for backup tasks              |
| riot     | Uploaded data parse errors        |

Parse errors for uploaded data go to the logger `org.apache.jena.riot`

The full name used in the logging provider setup is
of the form <code>org.apache.jena.fuseki.<i>&lt;NAME&gt;</i>
except for `org.apache.jena.riot`.

Logging default to level `INFO`.

Any externally set logging setup takes precidence over the Fuseki default
logging configuration.

#### Server packaging

Logging goes to stderr.

The logging pattern is `%d{HH:mm:ss} %-5p %-15c{1} :: %m%n`.

#### webapp (WAR file) packaging

Logging goes to stdout.

The logging pattern is `[%d{yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss}] %-10c{1} %-5p %m%n`.

#### Embedded mode:

The default for logging is silent. To instead use the Fuseki setup, call
`FusekiLogging.setLogging();` before any jena code is called. Then
logging is the same as the server packaging.

### `Request` log

In all cases, the `Request` uses the plain pattern `%m%n` and the format
follows the [Common Log Format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Log_Format)
used by many log analysis tools. The log defaults to `OFF`.
